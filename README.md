## About

This project intends to serve as a portable SDK for interfacing with EaganMatrix devices.

It includes tools, and a portable static library with a "C" ABI suitable for use from any language that can call C.

This project uses [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) as the build environment and source language for the tools.
The SDK itself (em-lib) is written in C/C++.
It aims to require minimal or no standard library support at runtime.
The `em-lib` is 'bring-your-own-allocator' (BYOA) and performs no memory management itself.
